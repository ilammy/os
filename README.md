# Object System (Name Subject to Change)

Object System is a portable object system for R7RS-compliant Schemes.

## Running

~~I'm using [Chibi Scheme](//code.google.com/p/chibi-scheme) for development (the latest build from Mercurial trunk).~~

No, for _development_ I'm using R6RS Scheme run by (Dr)Racket. Trace debugging this tangle of objects is hard.

Object System is distributed under **[3-clause BSD license](LICENSE)**.
